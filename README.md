# Strategic Flight Prediction
This repo hosts all the code for my bachelor thesis in the field of strategic flight delay distribution prediction.

## Note
The flight schedule data is not directly included due too large file sizes. It was originally collected from the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx?gnoyr_VQ=FGJ&QO_fu146_anzr=b0-gvzr).
